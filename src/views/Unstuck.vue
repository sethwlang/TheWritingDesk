          <p  >
          If you’re like a lot of writers, finding (or making) time to write without external accountability feels
          impossible—it’s too easy to put off the writing until a someday that never comes. However, the American
          Society of Training and Development found that accountability appointments increase your odds of success
          by <span class="italic">up to 95%!</span>
          </p>

          <p  >That’s why I created the Accountability Program.</p>

          <p  >
          The Accountability Program consists of 6 bi-weekly meetings across 3 months where we:</p> 
          <ul class="list-disc ml-5    ">
            <li>Set realistic, achievable goals</li>
            <li>Build research-driven writing habits</li>
            <li>Analyze and overcome challenges, and</li>
            <li>Review your progress.</li>
          </ul>
          <p  >You get regular, one-on-one access to a highly trained writing educator—that’s me!—to keep you on track and celebrate each milestone you reach.</p>
        </div>

      </div>
    </div>
   
      <div class="text-content paddington  ">
        <p>
        You also get worksheets for each meeting, which means you’ll finish this program with progress on your project
        <span class="italic">and</span> improved insights into your own writing process: what works, what doesn’t, and how to keep yourself on
        track.

    <p class="quote"><i>“Almost immediately, I was excited about my writing again. It felt different approaching my writing sessions
      knowing that I am not the only one engaged in them, that someone else also cares and is there for support, should
      I need it. I started a daily writing streak that is now 40 days and going strong, and I went from 31K words to
      over 63K words.”<strong>—Milena Velez, Chapin, SC. YA and Children’s Author.</strong></i></p>
