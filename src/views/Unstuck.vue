        <h1>Accountability Program</h1>
        <p>
        If you’re like a lot of writers, finding (or making) time to write without external accountability feels
        impossible—it’s too easy to put off the writing until a someday that never comes. However, the American
        Society of Training and Development found that accountability appointments can increase your odds of success
        by up to 95%!
        </p>

        <p>That’s where the Accountability Program comes in.</p>

        <p>
        The program consists of a series of meetings where we set goals, review your progress, and analyze
        challenges. You get regular, one-on-one access to a highly trained writing educator—that’s me!—to keep you on
        track and celebrate your progress.
        </p>

      You’ll also get worksheets for each meeting, which means you’ll finish this program with progress on your project
      and improved insights into your own writing process: what works, what doesn’t, and how to keep yourself on
      track.

      You’ve waited long enough to finish your book. It’s time to take the next step. Contact me to learn more
      about the program and set up an initial free consultation!

    <p class="quote fade-reveal"><i>“Almost immediately, I was excited about my writing again. It felt different approaching my writing sessions
      knowing that I am not the only one engaged in them, that someone else also cares and is there for support, should
      I need it. I started a daily writing streak that is now 40 days and going strong, and I went from 31K words to
      over 63K words.”—Milena Velez, Chapin, SC. Children’s Writer.</i></p>
