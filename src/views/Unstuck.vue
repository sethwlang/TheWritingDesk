        <p>If you’re like a lot of writers, finding (or making) time to write without external accountability feels
          impossible—it’s too easy to put off the writing until a someday that never comes. However, the American
          Society of Training and Development found that accountability appointments can increase your odds of success
          by up to 95%!</p><br/>

        <p>That’s where the Accountability Program comes in.</p><br/>

        <p>The program consists of a series of meetings where we set goals, review your progress, and analyze
          challenges. You get regular, one-on-one access to a highly trained writing educator—that’s me!—to keep you on
          track and celebrate your progress.</p><br/>

    <p>You’ll also get worksheets for each meeting, which means you’ll finish this program with progress on your project
      and improved insights into your own writing process: what works, what doesn’t, and how to keep yourself on
      track.</p><br/>

    <p>You’ve waited long enough to finish your book. It’s time to take the next step. Contact me [link] to learn more
      about the program and set up an initial free consultation!</p><br/>

    <p><i>“Almost immediately, I was excited about my writing again. It felt different approaching my writing sessions
      knowing that I am not the only one engaged in them, that someone else also cares and is there for support, should
      I need it. I started a daily writing streak that is now 40 days and going strong, and I went from 31K words to
      over 63K words.”—Milena Velez, Chapin, SC. Children’s Writer.</i></p><br/>
