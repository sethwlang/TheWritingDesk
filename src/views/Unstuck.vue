          <p>Do you feel like it’s impossible to find time to write, or to build sustainable writing habits that you
            actually
            enjoy?</p>

          <p>Are you ready to learn how to write consistently, instead of waiting (and waiting…and waiting) for
            inspiration to
            strike?</p>

          <h4>Then the Get Unstuck Coaching Program is for you.</h4>

          <p>You have an amazing idea for a book. It’s a story you know you want to tell—a story you know will make a
            difference for your readers.</p>

          <p>Maybe you’ve tried to write. You bought the cute notebook, the perfect pens. You set writing goals.
            You envisioned the finished book on the shelf at your favorite local bookstore. </p>

          <p>Then you tried to put your writing plan into action…and it all fell apart. </p>

          <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
            <li>Your life is busy—something always seems like it should take priority over your writing. </li>
            <li>Distractions are constant—social media is right there, your phone is going off, and your kid wants a
              snack. </li>
            <li>The blank page is intimidating—the path from “Once upon a time” to “The end” is winding and murky.
              You wonder: Are you really up for the challenge?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You want your writing life to feel easy. Joyful. Spacious. Consistent.
            You want to be able to tell your story and get your book out into the world.</p>

          <p>You want your writing process to feel less like pulling teeth and more like a dance with your imagination.

      <h4>That’s why I created Get Unstuck.</h4>

      <p>Get Unstuck is a 5-month coaching program focused on the strategies that will help you write consistently. During
        your 10 one-on-one
        coaching sessions, you’ll learn how to build, experiment with, customize, implement,
        and sustain effective writing habits. </p>
      <p>By the time the program is done, you’ll have the tools you need to build a consistent writing practice that
        aligns with your energy, your life, and your schedule. </p>
      <p>Here’s how it works:</p>

      <p>Each month, you’ll get 2 one-on-one coaching sessions with a highly trained writing educator (that’s me!).
        We’ll dive into your writing habits, smash through the roadblocks between you and the page, and develop new,
        customized approaches to writing. </p>
      <div class="flex flex-row">
        <div>
          <p>You’ll learn:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc m-5">

              life.
            </li>
            <li>How to assess your existing writing process: Figure out what works, what doesn't, and what to do about it.
            </li>
            <li>Strategies for finding time to write: You don’t need as much time as you might think!</li>
            <li>Methods for goal-setting that feel spacious and energizing</li>
            <li>How to analyze and adjust your new habits: Life happens! You’ll know how to tweak your habits to fit
              changes
              to
              your schedule or goals.</li>

          <p>In addition to one-on-one coaching, you’ll get resources you can return to again and again, including:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
            <li>The Get Unstuck workbook. We’ll both contribute to the workbook, creating a detailed record of your
              reflections,
              my suggestions, and your progress.</li>
            <li>Progress trackers. As you set goals, you’ll use progress trackers to help you see your progress over time.
            </li>
            <li>Access to me between sessions. We’ll meet live, but writing questions can pop up anytime. You can contact
              me
              between sessions, and I’ll provide ongoing guidance.</li>

        <h4>Does the Get Unstuck Program Work?</h4>
        <p class="quote white-bg quote-unstuck">
          <i>I wondered if this program would work with my current writing habits, and also was concerned about
            adding one more thing to be accountable about, on top of a full-time job and full-time parenting</i><br>
          <b><i>Almost immediately, I was excited about my writing again.</i></b><br>
          <i>It felt different approaching my writing sessions knowing that I am not the only one engaged in them, that
            someone else also cares and is there for support.
            I started a daily writing streak that is now 40 days and going strong, and I went from 31K words to over 63K
            words.</i>
