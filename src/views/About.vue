    <p>Hi! I’m Bailey Lang</p>

    <p>Once, I thought I would be a marketing analyst forever, but that all changed when I started a master’s degree in rhetoric and writing. Before I knew it, I’d <a href="#" >written a book</a>, left my corporate job, and started a PhD program in rhetoric and writing studies.</p>

    <p>By the time I finished my dissertation, I realized helping other writers—my undergraduate students, business owners, academics, novelists, and more—is what truly lights me up inside.</p>

    <p><b>Now, I help writers and businesses tell stories that matter.</b></p>

    <p>Writing is hard. We’ve all experienced the terror of a blank page, a blinking cursor, and a looming deadline. Whether you’re trying to launch new website copy or finish your book, finding the right words can be hard.</p>

    <p>Finding the right support doesn’t have to be! Here at The Writing Desk, I offer a range of services that can help you get your writing from a vague idea to a finished product.</p>
