          <p  >As comedian, writer, and musician Steve Martin said, “Some people have a way with words, and other 
            people…not have way.” </p>

          <p  >I have a way of helping people find their way with words. </p>

          <p  >If you feel like you’re one of the “not have way” types—or need some help figuring 
            out a way—you’ve come to the right place. </p>

          <p  >Here at The Writing Desk, you’ll find everything you need to get from draft to done. </p>

      <p>I started my career as a marketing analyst but quickly fell in love with rhetoric and writing studies while 
        working on a master’s degree. Before I knew it, I’d <a href="https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/potomac-books/9781612347660/">written a book</a> and left my corporate job for a Ph.D. program.</p>
        <p>By the time I finished my dissertation, I healized that helping other writers is what I was meant to do.</p>
        <p><b>Now, I help businesses and writers tell stories that matter. </b></p>
        <p>That said, I’ll be the first one to admit it: Writing is hard!</p>
        <p>You’ve probably already experienced the terror of a blank page, a blinking cursor, and a looming deadline. </p>
        <p>Whether you’re launching a new website or trying to finish a book, getting words (much less the right words) onto the page can be a challenge. </p>
        <p>Finding the right support doesn’t have to be. Here’s what it’s like to work with me!</p>
