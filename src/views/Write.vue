        <p>You already know good writing is essential to your business: you need copy that converts, emails that 
          people want to open, and content that speaks directly to your audience. I’d love to work with you on articles, 
          blog posts, newsletters, and press releases.</p>

        <p>Working with a writer should make your life easier, so I’ll bring all my writing knowledge to bear 
          on every one of your projects.</p>

        <p>I’m a learner by nature, and my experience helps me get up to speed and into your brand voice—fast.</p>

        <p><a href="https://calendly.com/the-writing-desk/free-consultation" >Contact me</a> with a short description of your project and we’ll chat.</p>

        <p>Your business matters—and so does your copy. Let’s get started.</p>

        <p>Publishing an article, white paper, or book can be a great way to tell a story you’re passionate about and
           connect with your audience on a deeper level. </p>

        <p style="width:570px;">However, writing can be a bit more challenging. That’s where I come in.</p>

        <p style="width:624px;">Whether you have a draft, an outline, or a list of ideas on a sticky note, 
          I’ll help you get a finished piece out the door.</p>

        <p>Need help figuring  out where to even start with a book project? No worries! You also get the support that comes 
          from my experience conducting research and managing large projects. </p>
<p>Ghostwriting is a collaborative process; you can have as much or as little engagement with the 
  writing process as you want.</p>
  <p>Investing in ghostwriting means investing in your ideas and the writing expertise needed to bring them to life. </p>
  <p>If you'd like to talk about ghostwriting, set up a <a href="https://calendly.com/the-writing-desk/free-consultation">free 30-minute consultation</a> to discuss your project! </p>
        <p>I have a limited number of ghostwriting slots, so don’t wait!</p>
