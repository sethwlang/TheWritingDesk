    <h2>Copywriting</h2>

    <p>You already know that good writing is essential to your business—you need copy that converts, emails that get
      opened, and content that speaks directly to your audience. I’d love to work with you on developing marketing
      collateral, email campaigns, website copy, press releases, and more.</p><br/>

    <p>I’m a learner by nature, and my experience in academia and corporate marketing helps me quickly get up to speed
      on new industries and product offerings. I’ll slip into your brand voice and bring all my writing knowledge to
      every project.</p><br/>

    <p>Before you know it, I’ll feel like another member of the team.</p><br/>

    <p>It’s easy to get started! Just contact me [link] with a short description of your project and any questions you
      have, and we’ll go from there.</p><br/>

    <p>Your business matters—and so does your copy. Let’s get started.</p>

    <h2>Proposal Writing</h2>
    <p>Requests for proposal can be time-consuming, technical, and overwhelming. That’s part of why I enjoy writing
      them!</p><br/>

    <p>If your sales team is overwhelmed by trying to sell and respond to RFPs, it’s time to offload some of that
      burden—let your team focus on what they do best, and let me handle the rest.</p><br/>

    <p>Few things are more expensive than losing out on a great opportunity because of missed deadlines or requirements!
      I work with clients from a range of industries (accounting, construction, education, healthcare, management
      consulting, and more) on preparing carefully crafted proposal materials, as well as building a robust library of
      RFP content that you can use for years to come.</p><br/>

    <p>We can work together on an ongoing or as-needed basis, and I build flexibility into my schedule to help respond
      to tight proposal timelines.</p><br/>

    <p>Just <a href="#">contact me</a> to set up a time to discuss your business and proposal needs.</p>

      to work with and I will definitely tap her in the future for more projects involving written content."—Wayne J.,

    <h2>Ghostwriting</h2>

    <p>Publishing an eBook can be a great way to drive interest in your business or tell a story you’re passionate
      about. Writing the book itself, however, can be a bit more challenging. That’s where I come in.</p><br/>

    <p>Whether you have a draft, an outline, or a list of ideas on a sticky note, I can help you write your book.</p><br/>

    <p>My background in writing includes everything from academic research to lead magnet eBooks and beyond. You also
      get the support that comes from my experience with research and managing large writing projects. Ghostwriting is a
      collaborative process, and you can have as much or as little engagement with the writing process as you want.</p><br/>

    <p>Investing in a book project means investing in your ideas and the writing expertise needed to bring them to life.
      If you’re interested in talking more about ghostwriting, contact me [link] with a brief description of your book
      and any questions.</p><br/>

    <p>I have a limited number of ghostwriting slots, so don’t wait!</p>
