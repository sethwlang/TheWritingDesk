      <h2>Developmental Editing</h2>
      <p>You’ve completed a draft of your book. Now what?</p>

      <p>Developmental editing provides insight into big-picture items like pacing, dialogue, and structure. You get a
        professional editorial perspective on your manuscript, along with specific, actionable feedback.</p><br/>

      <p>You’ve put an incredible amount of work into finishing your draft, and it’s ready for some expert insight. I
        bring more than a decade of writing and editing experience to the table, and provide developmental edits for
        fiction, nonfiction, and academic writers.</p><br/>

      <p>Developmental editing is an investment in your growth as a writer and in the worth of your writing. You’ll
        receive two documents from me: your manuscript with my in-line comments. and a summary document with my central
        observations and recommendations. We’ll also meet twice—at the start of the project and after I’ve provided my
        comments—so I can answer all your questions.</p><br/>

      <p>I have a limited number of slots available for developmental editing, so don’t wait! Contact me to
        schedule a free 15-minute consultation.</p><br/>

        <h2>Line Editing, Copy Editing, and Proofreading</h2>
        <p>
        Developmental editing helps you identify big-picture items for revision, but doesn’t focus on style,
        technical
        considerations, or typos. However, your work also deserves the TLC of line editing, copy editing, and
        proofreading.
        </p>

        <p>
        Spell check and grammar check are useful tools, but they’re still no match for a human editor who understands
        context—as well as how, when, and why to break the rules.
        </p>

        <p>
        I offer the following editing services for manuscripts, website copy, marketing collateral, and any other
        writing projects you’re working on:
        </p>

        <h3>Line Editing</h3>

        <p>
        While line editing, I focus on content, style, and language use. Line editing helps identify overused phrases,
        inconsistencies in style, and other issues to ensure your project is readable and accessible.
        </p>

        <h3>Copy Editing</h3>

        <p>
        Copy editing emphasizes technical considerations like grammar, spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure.
        If you’re using an in-house style guide or APA, MLA, or Chicago style, I’ll make sure your project adheres to
        those guidelines.

    <section class="bg-primary-light">
      <h3>Proofreading</h3>

      <p>Proofreading is the last edit before a project is published—this is where I check the document for any typos,
        extra spaces, or formatting issues. When your project is ready to spread its wings and fly, proofreading will
        help clear the runway.</p><br/>

      <p>You can purchase editing services individually or as a discounted bundle of all 3 services.</p><br/>

      <p>While developmental editing is only available for completed manuscripts, I’m happy to provide line edits and
        copy edits for partially completed documents. On a tight timeline? I can still help! There is a fee for rush
        edits.</p><br/>

      <p>At the end of the editing process, you’ll receive an edited copy of your document, along with a summary
        explaining what changes I made, why I made them, and any patterns I noticed.</p><br/>

      <p>The cost of putting poorly edited work out into the world is astronomical—investing in edits ahead of time
        saves time, money, and embarrassment. Contact me to get started!</p><br/>
