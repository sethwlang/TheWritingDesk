        <h2>Developmental Editing</h2>
        <p>You’ve completed a draft of your book. Now what?</p>
        <p>Now it’s time to think about developmental editing. </p>
        <p>Developmental editing provides insight into big-picture items like pacing, dialogue, and structure for finished manuscripts.</p> 
        <p>When working with me on develpmental edits, you'll get a professional editorial perspective on your manuscript, along with specific, actionable feedback.</p>

        <p>You’ve put an incredible amount of work into finishing your draft, and it’s ready for some expert insight.</p> 
        <p> I bring more than a decade of writing and editing experience to the table. I provide developmental edits for
          writers working on:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
            <li class="indent-1">Fiction—especially science fiction, fantasy, and romance</li>
            <li>Nonfiction—with an emphasis on business, leadership, and self-help</li>
            <li>Academic monographs and articles—particularly in the humanities</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Developmental editing is an investment in your growth as a writer and in the worth of your writing.</p>
        <p> You’ll receive two documents from me:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
        <li>A copy of your manuscript with my in-line comments</li>
        <li>A summary document with my central observations and recommendations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We’ll also meet twice—once at the start of the project and once after I’ve provided my comments—so I can answer all your questions.</p>
        <p>I have a limited number of slots available for developmental editing, so don’t wait! <a href="https://calendly.com/the-writing-desk/15min"  target="_blank">Contact me</a> to
          schedule a free 15-minute consultation.</p><br/>

        <h2>Line Editing, Copy Editing,<br> and Proofreading</h2>
        <p>
        Developmental editing helps you identify big-picture items for revision, but doesn’t focus on style,
        technical
        considerations, or typos. However, your work also deserves the TLC of line editing, copy editing, and
        proofreading.
        </p>

        <p>
        Spell check and grammar check are useful tools, but they’re still no match for a human editor who understands
        context—as well as how, when, and why to break the rules.
        </p>

        <p>
        I offer the following editing services for manuscripts, website copy, marketing collateral, and any other
        writing projects you’re working on:

        <h3>Line Editing</h3>

        <p>
        While line editing, I focus on content, style, and language use. Line editing helps identify overused phrases,
        inconsistencies in style, and other issues to ensure your project is readable and accessible.
        </p>

        <h3>Copy Editing</h3>

        <p>
        Copy editing emphasizes technical considerations like grammar, spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure.
        If you’re using an in-house style guide or APA, MLA, or Chicago style, I’ll make sure your project adheres to
        those guidelines.
        </p>

        <h3>Proofreading</h3>

        <p>Proofreading is the last edit before a project is published—this is where I'll check your work for any typos,
          extra spaces, or formatting issues. When your project is ready to spread its wings and fly, proofreading clears the runway.</p><br/>

        <p>You can purchase any editing services individually, or get a discount when bundling all three.</p><br/>

        <p>At the end of the editing process, you’ll receive an edited copy of your document, along with a summary
          explaining what changes I made, why I made them, and any patterns I noticed.</p><br/>

        <p>The cost of putting poorly edited work out into the world is astronomical—investing in edits ahead of time
          saves time, money, and embarrassment. Contact me to get started!</p><br/>
